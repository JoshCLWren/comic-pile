"""Shared executable-eligibility semantics for ComicPile work selectors.

This module is the single canonical home for the pure eligibility rules used
by both work-selection paths:

- ``scripts/next_task.py`` — the local/Ralph issue selector, and
- ``.github/scripts/factory_work_policy.py`` — the fixed-model controller.

Both selectors must agree on what makes an issue executable. Historically each
carried its own copy of the epic/PRD, manual-only, dependency, blocked-label,
and ownership rules, and the copies drifted. Import from here instead of
reimplementing the rules.

Manual-only directive contract
------------------------------
Autonomous execution is excluded only by a standalone HTML-comment directive
on its own line, outside fenced code blocks and inline code spans::

    <!-- factory-execution:manual-only -->

Raw substring matching is explicitly NOT the contract: merely discussing the
marker in prose or quoting it in code (for example, in backticks) must never
exclude an issue. To mention the marker without triggering exclusion, wrap it
in code spans or omit the ``<!-- -->`` delimiters.

Dependency declaration contract
-------------------------------
Explicit prerequisites are declared in exactly two structured forms:

1. An inline ``Depends on #N[, #M ...]`` cluster. Only the leading reference
   cluster counts: consecutive ``#N`` tokens joined by ``and``/``,``/``+``.
   Prose or casual ``#N`` mentions later on the line end the cluster.
2. A dependency heading (``## Dependencies``, ``Depends on:``,
   ``Blocked by``, ``Prerequisites``) followed by list items carrying
   ``#N`` references, one per item.

Markdown wrapping (backticks, bold, ``[#N](url)`` links) around a reference
never hides a declaration: formatting is normalized before extraction.

``ralph-task`` / ``ralph-status:pending`` scope
----------------------------------------------
Those two labels are Ralph-selector metadata, not universal execution
metadata. ``scripts/next_task.py`` requires them because it serves the local
Ralph queue. The fixed-model controller (which owns fixed-model dispatch)
never requires them and selects on factory labels instead. See
``docs/FACTORY_QUEUE_ELIGIBILITY.md`` for the authoritative role table.

Trust tiers for GitHub comments
-------------------------------
Machine-consumed markers (lease activity, no-diff retry accounting,
strike-reset scans) must be workflow-posted: ``machine_marker_is_trusted``
requires ``performed_via_github_app.slug == github-actions``. A bare
``OWNER``/``MEMBER``/``COLLABORATOR`` association also arises from
token-authenticated API calls, so it proves nothing about workflow provenance
and must not authorize machine markers. Explicit human authorization remains a
separate, human-interpreted signal — never a marker-shaped comment.
