# Worker GitHub App identities

Provenance key is the worker number, not the App slug. A model swap keeps the same App and the same name. Model and worker number stay in human-readable PR text. No `comicpile` prefix and no model name in the App slug. GitHub appends `[bot]`.

Worker 48 is provisioned as **Mark Cordova** (`mark-cordova[bot]`), App ID
`5275306`, installation ID `170306933`. The installation is scoped only to
`JoshCLWren/comic-pile`, and the three worker-48 repository secrets are configured.
Workers other than 48 keep using `PR_REBASE_TOKEN` for push and pull-request creation.

## Shared producer retirement (issue #3140)

`PR_REBASE_TOKEN` stays only while an active worker still pushes through it.
The executable form of that condition lives in
`.github/scripts/factory_shared_token_retirement.py`:

```sh
python3 .github/scripts/factory_shared_token_retirement.py plan   # census, always exits 0
python3 .github/scripts/factory_shared_token_retirement.py check  # ordering guard
```

The census reads `.github/factory-expected-workers.json` for the active roster and
this mapping for identities. A worker counts as independent only when its mapping
row is complete and `factory_worker_github_app.credential_decision` already selects
its installation token, so a committed row cannot retire the producer ahead of
routing support. Retired workers are never dependents: retired worker 72 is not a
reason to keep the shared token.
`tests/test_issue_3140_shared_token_retirement.py` fails on premature removal of
either producer half (the Python fallback, or the secret export plus shared git
remote wiring in `free-model-factory-run.yml`) while active dependents remain, and
on overdue removal (no dependents remain but a half is still wired).

## Bootstrap (already done for worker 48)

Faker **40.40.0**, locale `en_US`, a brand-new `Faker()` per worker, `seed_instance(worker_number + 100)`, then `name()` as the first call. Worker 48's first `name()` is **Mark Cordova**. That name is persisted in `.github/factory-worker-github-apps.json`. Later reads must not re-roll it.

If the globally unique GitHub App name is taken when Josh creates the App, call `name()` once more on that same seeded instance, persist that second name, and stop.

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/factory_worker_github_app.py bootstrap-name 48
python3 .github/scripts/factory_worker_github_app.py bootstrap-collision 48
```

## Terminal provisioning (preferred)

Use the resumable [owner-run provisioning helper](../docs/WORKER_APP_PROVISIONING.md).
It prepares the manifest, captures the generated private key, verifies installation,
and uploads the three secrets without manual credential copying. An interactive
agent may drive creation and installation only with Josh's explicit session
authorization; scheduled workers remain prohibited.

```sh
node .github/scripts/provision-worker-app.cjs start
node .github/scripts/provision-worker-app.cjs finish
```

## Manual fallback

The original scaffolding did not create the App. The following manual path remains
available if manifest registration cannot be used.

1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App.
2. Name: `Mark Cordova` (or the one persisted collision fallback). GitHub will append `[bot]`. Do not put `comicpile` or a model id in the name or slug.
3. Description: the `profile` string in `.github/factory-worker-github-apps.json` (it must say this is an autonomous ComicPile Factory worker).
4. Homepage: `https://github.com/JoshCLWren/comic-pile`.
5. Webhook: inactive.
6. Repository permissions, least privilege for push and pull-request creation:
   - Contents: Read and write
   - Pull requests: Read and write
   - Issues: Read and write (readable handoff comments)
   - Metadata: Read-only (GitHub requires it)
7. Installation: only this account. Install **only** on `JoshCLWren/comic-pile`.
8. Generate a private key. Do not commit it.
9. Repository Actions secrets (names are the contract; values stay in secrets):
   - `FACTORY_WORKER_48_APP_ID`
   - `FACTORY_WORKER_48_INSTALLATION_ID` (the id from the installation URL)
   - `FACTORY_WORKER_48_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (PEM)
10. Optionally commit `app_id`, `app_login`, and `installation_id` into the worker 48 mapping entry. Do not re-roll `display_name`.

When all three secrets exist, only worker 48 switches push and PR creation onto a
short-lived installation token. Missing any secret fails back to `PR_REBASE_TOKEN`.
No other worker consults this mapping.

Worker Apps stay off every trusted-marker author path. `TRUSTED_FACTORY_APP_SLUGS` remains `github-actions` only. A worker App comment is not trusted even if GitHub reports a trusted association.

## Readable handoffs (#3135)

When worker 48's App secrets are all present, human-readable implementation,
repair, and review handoff comments are posted with the App installation token
(Mark Cordova[bot]). Machine/trusted marker comments stay on github-actions[bot]
and never use the worker App token. Missing any secret keeps every identity on
the current path. This does not create the App.
