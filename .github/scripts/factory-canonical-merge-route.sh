# Canonical exact-head merge route for worker-direct factory merges.
#
# Worker wrappers that merge without the scheduled drain must run the same
# trusted controller gate as the drain: exact-head mechanical gates plus the
# controller's issue-level acceptance, exact-commit review/CI and substantive
# delivery safeguards, including a fresh declared/native dependency check. After
# the merge they must use the canonical trusted post-merge closure policy instead
# of a raw ``gh issue close``.
#
# The controller and the closure module are staged from trusted main before any
# checkout_target switches onto a PR branch. This route only ever executes those
# staged copies; it never runs a PR-branch-controlled gate.
#
# Outcomes are exported through the FACTORY_* variables below so callers can log
# a truthful result and tests can execute this file directly:
#
#   FACTORY_MERGE_STATE         denied | merge-failed | merged
#   FACTORY_MERGE_GATE_DECISION pass | retry | deny | empty
#   FACTORY_MERGE_GATE_REASON   controller reason, or a fail-closed reason
#   FACTORY_CLOSURE_OUTCOME     canonical closure decision, or error text
#   FACTORY_CLOSURE_STATUS      closed | not-applicable | blocked | error
#
# Return codes for factory_merge_with_canonical_gates:
#   0  merged, closure completed or not applicable
#   1  gates did not pass; nothing merged (retry/deny/fail-closed)
#   2  merge command failed; nothing closed
#   3  merged, but post-merge closure blocked or could not be verified
