Found that roll.html rollTheDie() uses client-side Math.random() for animation (line 164), while server generates actual result. Client-side animation values are random and independent of server result. After animation, HTMX response replaces the entire #result div with server-side correct value. Need to ensure dice animation shows server result, not random client values.\n[2026-01-04T14:33:32.543340+00:00] Found root cause: rollTheDie() function was using client-side Math.random() to display random numbers on dice during animation (line 164). These values had no relationship to server-generated roll result. Fix: Removed the line that displayed random values during animation. Now dice only rotate during rolling without showing changing numbers. Final number is correctly displayed from server response when HTMX replaces the #result div.\n[2026-01-04T14:34:49.433971+00:00] Unclaimed by Alice\n[2026-01-04T15:00:19.024871+00:00] Worked in main repo (comic-pile).
