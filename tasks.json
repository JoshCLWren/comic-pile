      "description": "Create .env file in main repo with DATABASE_URL configured for PostgreSQL. This will switch the application from SQLite to PostgreSQL.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:\n- .env file created with DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://comicpile:comicpile_password@localhost:5435/comicpile (not in git due to .gitignore)\n- .env.example template created (commit e9c2caf in TASK-DOCKER-002)\n- app/database.py updated to read DATABASE_URL from environment variable with SQLite fallback (commit 684be8f)\n- PostgreSQL driver psycopg[binary]>=3.1.0 added to dependencies (commit 4c9288f)\n- Alembic configuration updated for PostgreSQL environment variable support (commit 684be8f)\n\nCURRENT BLOCKER: Merge conflict during review\n- pg-migrate-001 branch is behind main by 20+ commits\n- Branch was created before major merges (undo/history, rate limiting, task API improvements, etc.)\n- Worktree exists at /home/josh/code/comic-pile-pg-migrate-001\n- Git commit d3d8c51 shows SQLite cleanup documentation (related task PG-MIGRATE-006)\n\nSTEPS TO RESOLVE:\n1. Navigate to worktree: cd /home/josh/code/comic-pile-pg-migrate-001\n2. Rebase branch to main: git rebase main\n3. Resolve any merge conflicts (likely in tasks.json, documentation files)\n4. Verify .env configuration matches main branch expectations (DATABASE_URL environment variable support)\n5. Test PostgreSQL connectivity: make migrate (run migrations)\n6. Run tests: pytest (verify all tests pass with PostgreSQL)\n7. Run linting: make lint (ensure code quality)\n8. Merge to main: git checkout main && git merge pg-migrate-001\n9. Mark task as done via Task API or update tasks.json manually\n\nDEPENDENCIES (all completed):\n- TASK-DB-001: Add PostgreSQL driver to pyproject.toml (commit 4c9288f)\n- TASK-DB-002: Update app/database.py for environment-based database URL (commit 684be8f)\n- TASK-DB-003: Update Alembic configuration for PostgreSQL (commit 684be8f)\n- TASK-DOCKER-002: Create .env.example template (commit e9c2caf)\n\nVERIFICATION STEPS:\n1. Verify .env file exists with valid DATABASE_URL\n2. Check .env.example template has PostgreSQL configuration\n3. Run: python -c \"from app.database import engine; print(engine.url)\" and confirm PostgreSQL URL\n4. Run: make migrate (alembic upgrade head) - should succeed without errors\n5. Run: pytest -x (run tests) - all tests should pass\n6. Run: make lint (ruff + pyright) - no errors\n7. Access /health endpoint - should return 200 OK with database connectivity check\n8. Verify app starts with PostgreSQL: make dev or uvicorn app.main:app --reload\n9. Check docker-compose.yml works: docker-compose up -d postgres, docker-compose up app\n10. Backup verification: scripts/backup_postgres.sh should work\n\nPOST-MERGE CLEANUP:\n1. Remove worktree after successful merge: git worktree remove /home/josh/code/comic-pile-pg-migrate-001\n2. Delete pg-migrate-001 branch: git branch -d pg-migrate-001\n3. Update PG-MIGRATE-002 task status to unblocked (depends on PG-MIGRATE-001)\n\nNOTES:\n- .env file is in .gitignore, so only .env.example is tracked in git\n- PostgreSQL database must be running on localhost:5435 (or update DATABASE_URL accordingly)\n- Application supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL environment variable\n- Migration scripts for SQLite to PostgreSQL are in scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py (TASK-DB-004)\n- SQLite cleanup procedure documented in docs/SQLITE_CLEANUP.md (commit d3d8c51, PG-MIGRATE-006)",

Verify data integrity after migration.\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n- Migration script: scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py\n  - Migrates all tables: users, threads, sessions, events, tasks, settings\n  - Preserves foreign key relationships\n  - Uses SQLAlchemy merge for idempotent operations\n\n- Verification tests: tests/test_migration_verification.py\n  - Row count validation between SQLite and PostgreSQL\n  - Data integrity checks for all tables\n  - Foreign key relationship validation\n  - Null value handling tests\n  - Empty table migration tests\n\n- Backup script: scripts/backup_postgres.sh\n  - Creates gzipped PostgreSQL backups\n  - Automatic backup rotation (max 10 backups)\n  - Backup integrity verification\n\n- Documentation: docs/SQLITE_CLEANUP.md (commit d3d8c51)\n  - Complete SQLite cleanup procedure\n  - Verification steps\n  - Rollback procedures for 4 scenarios\n  - Common issues and solutions\n\n### Current Blocker\n\nThis task is **blocked** due to:\n1. **Merge conflict during review** - Cannot merge to main\n2. **Dependency on PG-MIGRATE-001** - Must merge PG-MIGRATE-001 first (also blocked by merge conflict)\n\n### Dependency Chain\n\n```\nPG-MIGRATE-001 (Create .env with DATABASE_URL) [BLOCKED - merge conflict]\n    \u2193\nPG-MIGRATE-002 (Run data migration) [BLOCKED - merge conflict, depends on PG-MIGRATE-001]\n    \u2193\nPG-MIGRATE-003 (Update test config) [DONE - depends on PG-MIGRATE-002]\nPG-MIGRATE-004 (Update docs) [DONE - depends on PG-MIGRATE-001]\nPG-MIGRATE-005 (Create verification tests) [DONE - depends on PG-MIGRATE-002]\nPG-MIGRATE-006 (Document cleanup) [DONE - depends on PG-MIGRATE-002, PG-MIGRATE-005]\n```\n\n### Steps to Resolve Merge Conflict\n\n1. **First, resolve PG-MIGRATE-001 (prerequisite)**\n   - Check worktree status: git status in main repo\n   - Identify conflicting files (likely .env or related config)\n   - Merge manually or rebase PG-MIGRATE-001 branch onto main\n   - Run tests: pytest tests/\n   - Run lint: make lint\n   - Merge to main\n   - Mark PG-MIGRATE-001 as done\n\n2. **Then resolve PG-MIGRATE-002**\n   - Rebase or merge PG-MIGRATE-002 onto updated main\n   - Review merge conflicts (if any remain after PG-MIGRATE-001 merge)\n   - Resolve conflicts keeping both:\n     - Migration script changes\n     - Test files\n     - Documentation\n   - Run migration verification tests:\n     ```bash\n     pytest tests/test_migration_verification.py -v\n     ```\n   - Run all tests:\n     ```bash\n     pytest tests/ -v\n     ```\n   - Run lint:\n     ```bash\n     make lint\n     ```\n   - Merge to main\n   - Mark PG-MIGRATE-002 as done\n\n### Verification Steps to Confirm Migration Works\n\nAfter resolving conflicts and merging:\n\n1. **Verify PostgreSQL connection**\n   ```bash\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n   python -c \"from app.database import engine; print(engine.url)\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Run migration script**\n   ```bash\n   python scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py\n   ```\n   Expected output: Migrated X users, Y threads, Z sessions, etc.\n\n3. **Run verification tests**\n   ```bash\n   pytest tests/test_migration_verification.py -v\n   ```\n   All tests must pass.\n\n4. **Compare row counts**\n   ```bash\n   # SQLite counts\n   sqlite3 comic_pile.db \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;\"\n   sqlite3 comic_pile.db \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM threads;\"\n   \n   # PostgreSQL counts\n   psql $DATABASE_URL -c \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;\"\n   psql $DATABASE_URL -c \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM threads;\"\n   ```\n   All counts must match exactly.\n\n5. **Start application**\n   ```bash\n   make dev\n   ```\n   Verify at http://localhost:8000:\n   - Application loads\n   - Data is visible\n   - Features work (roll, rate, queue)\n\n6. **Run full test suite**\n   ```bash\n   pytest tests/ -v\n   pytest --cov=comic_pile --cov-report=term-missing\n   ```\n   Coverage must be >= 96%.\n\n### How to Rollback If Needed\n\n#### Scenario 1: Migration Failed - Need to Retry\n\n```bash\n# Reset PostgreSQL database\npsql $DATABASE_URL -c \"DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;\"\n\n# Recreate schema with Alembic\nmake migrate\n\n# Re-run migration\npython scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py\n```\n\n#### Scenario 2: PostgreSQL Issues - Switch Back to SQLite\n\n```bash\n# Update .env to use SQLite\nnano .env\n# Set: DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./comic_pile.db\n\n# Restart application\nmake dev\n```\n\n#### Scenario 3: Need to Restore PostgreSQL from Backup\n\n```bash\n# Create backup before retrying\nbash scripts/backup_postgres.sh\n\n# If migration corrupts data, restore:\ngunzip < backups/postgres/postgres_backup_comicpile_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz | psql $DATABASE_URL\n```\n\n#### Scenario 4: Complete Rollback - Use SQLite Backups\n\n```bash\n# Restore SQLite database (if you have a backup)\ntar -xzf ~/comic-pile-backups/comic_pile.db.backup.*.tar.gz\n\n# Update .env to use SQLite\nnano .env\n# Set: DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./comic_pile.db\n\n# Restart application\nmake dev\n\n# Verify data\nsqlite3 comic_pile.db \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;\"\n```\n\n### Files Modified by This Task\n\n- scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py (NEW)\n- tests/test_migration_verification.py (NEW)\n- scripts/backup_postgres.sh (NEW)\n- docs/SQLITE_CLEANUP.md (NEW, commit d3d8c51)",

Explore goal tracking features to help users set and achieve reading targets.\n\n### Research Areas\n\n1. **Anti-Binge Mechanics**\n   - Per-series read limits (e.g., max 3 issues per session)\n   - Cooldown periods between reading same series\n   - Queue diversification (alternate between series)\n   - Warning indicators when approaching binge thresholds\n   - Optional/enforced restrictions\n\n2. **Goal Tracking**\n   - Daily/weekly/monthly issue targets\n   - Series completion goals\n   - Collection-wide reading goals\n   - Progress visualization (charts, dashboards)\n   - Streak tracking and motivation features\n\n3. **User Experience**\n   - How to present limits without feeling punitive\n   - Clear feedback on progress vs goals\n   - Configurable thresholds per user preference\n   - Override mechanisms for when users want to binge\n\n### Expected Deliverables\n\n**Research Document** (docs/ANTI_BINGE_GOAL_TRACKING_EXPLORATION.md)\n- User use cases and pain points\n- Anti-binge mechanic options with pros/cons\n- Goal tracking feature options with pros/cons\n- Database schema requirements for each option\n- API endpoints needed\n- UI/UX considerations\n- Implementation effort estimates\n- Recommendations with rationale\n\n### Current Status\n\n**Incomplete** - Research exploration has not been started. No research document exists. No investigation of anti-binge mechanics or goal tracking has been conducted.\n\n### Blockers\n\nNone identified. This is a research spike with no implementation dependencies.\n\n### Steps to Complete\n\n1. Review similar apps for anti-binge patterns (reading apps, habit trackers, social media)\n2. Create research document outline\n3. Document use cases for anti-binge reading\n4. Document use cases for goal tracking\n5. Research and document 3-4 anti-binge mechanic options\n6. Research and document 3-4 goal tracking options\n7. Analyze technical requirements for each option\n8. Create implementation effort estimates\n9. Provide recommendations\n10. Save research document to docs/ANTI_BINGE_GOAL_TRACKING_EXPLORATION.md\n11. Update task status to 'done'",
