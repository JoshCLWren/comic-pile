Work log summary (2026-01-10):

- Corrected D4 geometry to be a true tetrahedron with four equilateral faces.
- Rebuilt D10 geometry for a cleaner trapezohedron silhouette and corrected UV orientation so numbers are no longer mirrored.
- Added roll/rate/history consistency test to validate roll -> thread -> history alignment and ladder step behavior.
- Noted pytest coverage enforcement triggers when running single tests; full suite needed for coverage compliance.
