# MCP Server Evaluation: Task API as MCP vs Alternative Technologies

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-01  
**Task:** TASK-120  
**Prepared by:** opencode

---

## Executive Summary

This document evaluates whether to implement the Task API as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server or use alternative task management technologies. After comprehensive analysis of MCP capabilities, existing tools (Jira, Asana, GitHub Projects, Linear, Notion, Taskwarrior, Kanboard), and current custom REST API implementation, the recommendation is to **keep the current custom REST API while planning a future hybrid MCP adapter layer**.

**Key Finding:** MCP is promising for LLM-native integrations but remains immature for production use. Existing commercial tools are too heavyweight for hobbyist projects, while open-source alternatives lack agent-specific features like claiming and heartbeats.

## 1. MCP Overview and Capabilities

### 1.1 What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 for connecting AI assistants to external data and services. MCP acts as a bridge between LLMs and the outside world, enabling agents to access real-time data and perform actions.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Open Standard:** Community-driven specification, not vendor-locked
- **LLM-Native:** Designed specifically for AI agent workflows
- **Structured Communication:** Uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over multiple transports (stdio, SSE, HTTP)
- **Layered Architecture:** Tools (actions), Resources (data access), Prompts (templates)

### 1.2 MCP Architecture

```

### 1.3 MCP Server Implementation

MCP servers can be implemented in Python using the FastMCP framework:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Task Server", json_response=True)

@mcp.tool()
def list_tasks() -> list[dict]:
    """List all available tasks."""
    return [{"id": "TASK-120", "title": "..."}]

@mcp.tool()
def claim_task(task_id: str, agent_name: str) -> dict:
    """Claim a task for an agent."""
    return {"status": "claimed", "task_id": task_id}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="streamable-http")
```

### 1.4 MCP Benefits for Task Management

**Advantages:**
- **Native LLM Integration:** Built specifically for AI agents, no translation layer needed
- **Tool Invocation Pattern:** LLMs can discover and call task management functions directly
- **Structured Context:** Tools and resources expose schema that LLMs understand
- **Bidirectional Communication:** Supports real-time streaming (SSE) and async operations
- **Multiple Transports:** Works with CLI (stdio), web apps (SSE/HTTP), and desktop clients

**Disadvantages:**
- **Immature Ecosystem:** Introduced Nov 2024, limited production adoption
- **Limited UI Support:** Most MCP clients are AI-native (Claude Desktop, Cursor), not human-centric
- **Documentation Gaps:** Many examples are incomplete or educational only
- **Learning Curve:** New protocol, new tools, different mental model than REST APIs
- **Tool Discovery Complexity:** LLMs must understand tool signatures and parameter constraints

### 1.5 Existing MCP Task Servers

Research found several MCP task server implementations, all are early-stage or educational:

| Project | Stars | Status | Features | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| [tradesdontlie/task-manager-mcp](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@tradesdontlie/task-manager-mcp) | 25 | Active | Projects, PRD parsing, task tracking | Template implementation, educational focus |
| [milkosten/task-mcp-server](https://github.com/milkosten/task-mcp-server) | 11 | Active | Multi-transport (stdio/HTTP), external API wrapper | Connects to external task API, not standalone |
| [idsulik/todo-mcp-server](https://github.com/idsulik/todo-mcp-server) | Unknown | 2025-04 | Basic todo CRUD | Minimal implementation, no advanced features |
| [RegiByte/todo-list-mcp](https://github.com/regibyte/todo-list-mcp) | Unknown | Educational | Simple todo management | Created for educational purposes |
| [tkc/tinyt-todo-mcp](https://github.com/tkc/tinyt-todo-mcp) | Unknown | 2025-03 | Persistent task storage | Focuses on context persistence for LLMs |

**Key Observation:** No production-grade MCP task servers exist yet. All implementations are simple CRUD without advanced features like dependencies, heartbeats, or agent coordination.

### 1.6 MCP Maturity Assessment

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Protocol Stability** | Stable (spec v2025-11-25), but still evolving |
| **Client Support** | Growing: Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code extensions |
| **Server SDKs** | Python, TypeScript, Go - well-documented |
| **Production Deployments** | Limited to experimental/personal use |
| **Community Knowledge** | Sparse, few battle-tested patterns |
| **Long-term Viability** | Uncertain - depends on Anthropic/community adoption |

**Verdict:** MCP is promising but not production-ready for critical task management systems. Suitable for experimental AI workflows but risky for production deployment in early 2026.

## 5. Recommended Approach

### 5.1 Primary Recommendation: Keep Custom REST API

**Decision:** Maintain and improve the current custom REST API (`app/api/tasks.py`) as the primary task management solution.

**Rationale:**

1. **Perfect Fit for Use Case:** The current API was designed specifically for agent coordination with claiming, heartbeats, and dependencies - features that no existing tool provides out of the box.

2. **Low Cost:** 22-42 hours to extract and improve vs 140-205 hours for MCP or $2,000-4,000 for commercial tools.

3. **Fast Implementation:** Already functional, only needs cleanup and extraction as standalone service.

4. **Proven Technology:** REST APIs are stable, well-documented, and work with any client (browsers, LLMs, CLI tools).

5. **Self-Hosted:** No vendor lock-in, no recurring licensing fees.

6. **Adequate for LLMs:** While not LLM-native, REST APIs work perfectly well with OpenAI function calling, Anthropic tool use, and other agent frameworks.

### 5.2 Secondary Recommendation: Future MCP Adapter Layer

**Plan:** After the REST API is stable and production-ready, build a **MCP adapter layer** that wraps the REST API.

**Benefits:**
- **Best of Both Worlds:** Keep stable REST API for existing clients while adding MCP support for LLM-native agents.
- **Incremental Adoption:** Can adopt MCP gradually without disrupting current workflows.
- **Risk Mitigation:** If MCP fails to gain traction, REST API remains as fallback.
- **Strawler Pattern:** Wrapping existing API is safer than rewriting from scratch.

**Implementation:**
```python
# mcp_adapter.py
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
import httpx

mcp = FastMCP("Comic-Pile Task Adapter")
REST_API_BASE = "http://localhost:8000/api"

@mcp.tool()
async def list_tasks() -> list[dict]:
    """List all available tasks."""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(f"{REST_API_BASE}/tasks/")
        return response.json()

@mcp.tool()
async def claim_task(task_id: str, agent_name: str, worktree: str) -> dict:
    """Claim a task for an agent."""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            f"{REST_API_BASE}/tasks/{task_id}/claim",
            json={"agent_name": agent_name, "worktree": worktree}
        )
        return response.json()

# Heartbeat, status updates, etc. follow same pattern
```

**Timeline:**
- **Phase 1 (Now):** Extract and stabilize REST API (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 2 (Q2 2026):** Build MCP adapter (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase 3 (Q3 2026):** Deploy and test with Claude Desktop/Cursor (1 week)
- **Phase 4 (Q4 2026):** Evaluate adoption and decide on MCP-first approach (if mature)

### 5.3 Decision Matrix

|--------|--------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Initial Cost** | $1,100-2,100 | $7,000-10,250 | $2,000-4,000 + licensing | $2,350-4,000 |
| **Time to Value** | 2-3 weeks | 6-8 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 4-6 weeks |
| **Maintenance** | Low (1-2 hrs/quarter) | Medium (2-4 hrs/quarter) | High (3-5 hrs/quarter) | Medium (2-4 hrs/quarter) |
| **Agent Features** | Native ✅ | Native ✅ | Custom ⚠️ | Custom ⚠️ |
| **LLM Integration** | Good (REST) ✅ | Excellent (MCP) ✅ | Good (REST) ✅ | Good (REST/JSON-RPC) ✅ |
| **UI Included** | Yes ✅ | No ❌ | Yes ✅ | Yes ✅ |

## 8. Hybrid Approaches

### 8.1 MCP Server as Adapter Layer (Recommended Hybrid)

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  LLM Clients                   │
│  (Claude Desktop, Cursor, OpenAI Agents, etc.)  │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                  │ MCP Protocol
                  │ (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio/SSE)
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────────────┐
│              MCP Adapter Layer                 │
│        (FastMCP wrapper around REST API)        │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                  │ HTTP (REST)
                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────────────┐
│           Custom REST API Service              │
│    (Extracted from comic-pile, production)     │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────────────┐
│              Database (PostgreSQL)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- REST API remains stable for existing web UI and HTTP clients
- MCP adapter provides LLM-native interface for AI agents
- Can test MCP adoption without disrupting current workflows
- Lower risk than full rewrite
- Incremental development path

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Extract and stabilize REST API (2-3 weeks)
2. Build MCP adapter using FastMCP (1-2 weeks)
3. Deploy both services, configure routing (1 week)
4. Test with LLM clients, iterate based on feedback (1-2 weeks)

**Total Timeline:** 5-8 weeks

### 8.2 Sync Between Custom API and External Tool

**Use Case:** Leverage commercial tool's UI while maintaining custom agent features.

**Architecture:**
```
┌──────────────────────┐      ┌──────────────────────┐
│   Custom REST API    │◄────►│  External Tool       │
│ (Agent coordination) │ Sync │ (UI, reporting)     │
└──────────────────────┘      └──────────────────────┘
         ▲                             ▲
         │                             │
    Agents                          Humans
```

**Synchronization Strategy:**
- **One-Way Sync:** Custom API is source of truth, external tool is read-only mirror
- **Two-Way Sync:** Bidirectional sync with conflict resolution (complex)
- **Event-Driven Sync:** Use webhooks from external tool to trigger sync events

**Tools:**
- **GitHub Projects:** Sync tasks to issues via GitHub API
- **Notion:** Sync tasks to Notion database via REST/MCP
- **Jira:** Sync tasks to Jira issues via REST API

**Benefits:**
- Keep agent-specific features (claiming, heartbeats) in custom API
- Leverage commercial tool's rich UI and reporting
- Gradual migration path if tool works well

**Drawbacks:**
- Complexity of maintaining sync logic
- Data consistency challenges
- Additional latency between systems

### 8.3 Layered Architecture with Adapters

**Concept:** Custom core with pluggable adapters for different clients.

**Architecture:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Client Layer                        │
│  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐        │
│  │   Web   │  │   CLI   │  │   LLM   │        │
│  │   UI    │  │  Tool   │  │ Agents │        │
│  └────┬────┘  └────┬────┘  └────┬────┘        │
└───────┼────────────┼────────────┼───────────────┘
        │            │            │
        │ HTTP       │ HTTP       │ MCP/REST
        │            │            │
┌───────▼────────────▼────────────▼───────────────┐
│            Adapter Layer                          │
│  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐        │
│  │  Web    │  │  CLI    │  │   MCP   │        │
│  │ Adapter │  │ Adapter │  │ Adapter │        │
│  └────┬────┘  └────┬────┘  └────┬────┘        │
└───────┼────────────┼────────────┼───────────────┘
        │            │            │
        └────────────┼────────────┘
                     │
┌────────────────────▼─────────────────────────────┐
│         Task Management Core Service              │
│  (Business logic: claiming, heartbeats, deps)    │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                     │
┌────────────────────▼─────────────────────────────┐
│              Database Layer                      │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to add new clients (add new adapter)
- Core logic remains simple and testable
- Can evolve adapters independently

**Implementation:**
1. Extract core service from current API
2. Create web adapter (maintains current HTMX UI)
3. Create MCP adapter (future enhancement)
4. Create CLI adapter (future enhancement)

## 9. Conclusion and Next Steps

### 9.1 Summary of Findings

1. **MCP is promising but immature:** Introduced in November 2024, MCP shows great potential for LLM-native integrations but lacks production-ready implementations and has limited community knowledge.

2. **Existing tools don't fit agent workflows:** Commercial tools (Jira, Asana, Linear) are designed for human teams and lack agent-specific features like claiming mechanisms and heartbeat monitoring.

3. **Current custom REST API is optimal:** Built specifically for agent coordination, the existing task API provides all required features with minimal complexity and cost.

4. **Hybrid approach balances risk and innovation:** Wrapping the stable REST API with an MCP adapter provides LLM-native capabilities while maintaining a proven foundation.

### 9.2 Final Recommendation

**Primary Decision:** Extract and improve the current custom REST API as a standalone service.

**Secondary Decision:** Plan a future MCP adapter layer (6-12 months after REST API stabilizes).

**Rationale:**
- **Low risk:** REST is proven, stable, and well-understood
- **Fast value:** Can extract and deploy in 2-3 weeks
- **Cost-effective:** $1,100-2,100 vs $7,000+ for MCP from scratch
- **Future-ready:** Can add MCP adapter later if protocol matures
- **Perfect fit:** Already designed for agent coordination workflows

### 9.3 Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week):**
   - Create worktree: `git worktree add ../comic-pile-task-api-extract phase/extract-task-api`
   - Start API extraction from `app/api/tasks.py`
   - Define API contract (OpenAPI specification)

2. **Short-Term (2-4 Weeks):**
   - Complete API extraction as standalone FastAPI service
