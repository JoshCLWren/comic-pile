**Manager-5 Session - Fully Unsupervised Workflow**

You are running as Manager-5. This is a **fully unsupervised session** requiring NO manual intervention.

## Architecture

Two components run concurrently:

1. **Manager Daemon: Python Script** (`agents/manager_daemon.py`)
   - Runs in background terminal (NOT in opencode)
   - Monitors API every 2 minutes
   - Auto-reviews and merges in_review tasks
   - Auto-unblocks confused agent tasks
   - Detects stale workers
   - Stops automatically when all work done
   - NO Task tool access needed

2. **Worker Pool Manager: OPCODE Agent** (You launch this via Task tool)
   - Runs IN opencode interface (NOT as Python script)
   - Has access to Task tool
   - Monitors worker pool capacity (max 3) every 60 seconds
   - Spawns new worker agents via Task tool when needed
   - Uses sequential human names: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve...
   - Stops automatically when all work done

## Setup Phase (Do First - Launch Both Components)

**Step 1 - Start Manager Daemon (Background Python Script):**
```bash
mkdir -p logs
python3 agents/manager_daemon.py > logs/manager-5-daemon-$(date +%Y%m%d).log 2>&1 &
```

**Step 2 - Launch Worker Pool Manager (OPCODE Agent via Task Tool):**

Copy the entire `worker-pool-manager-prompt.txt` file and use it to launch as Worker Pool Manager agent:

The Worker Pool Manager agent will:
- Monitor worker pool every 60 seconds
- Spawn workers via Task tool when needed
- Stop automatically when all work done

**Step 3 - Monitor Logs (Optional):**
```bash
tail -f logs/manager-5-daemon-$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

**Browser - Coordinator dashboard (for visibility):**
```
http://localhost:8000/tasks/coordinator
```

## Verify Both Components Running

```bash
# Check manager daemon (Python script)
ps aux | grep manager_daemon

# Should show Python process

# Check worker pool manager (OPCODE agent)
# You'll see it actively running in this opencode session
```

## What's Fully Automated

**Manager Daemon handles:**
- ✅ Auto-reviews in_review tasks (pytest, linting, merge)
- ✅ Auto-unblocks confused agent tasks
- ✅ Detects stale workers (20+ min no heartbeat)
- ✅ Marks tasks blocked on conflicts/test failures
- ✅ Stops automatically when all tasks done

**Worker Pool Manager (OPCODE agent) handles:**
- ✅ Monitors worker pool capacity
- ✅ Spawns new worker agents via Task tool when needed
- ✅ Uses unique human names
- ✅ Detects when work is complete
- ✅ Stops automatically when all work done
- ✅ Reports summary at end

**You don't need to:**
- ❌ Monitor dashboard constantly
- ❌ Click buttons
- ❌ Spawn workers manually
- ❌ Monitor idle workers
- ❌ Detect when work is done
- ❌ Handle blocked tasks
- ❌ Resolve conflicts
- ❌ Run tests or linting

## When You SHOULD Intervene

Only in these rare cases:
- ⚠️ Merge conflicts (manual resolution in worktree)
- ⚠️ Test failures (debug and fix in worktree)
- ⚠️ Workers reporting critical issues repeatedly
- ⚠️ System crashes (restart both agents)

## Example Log Output

**Manager Daemon Log:**
```
[18:45:00] Starting manager daemon...
[18:45:00] Checking every 120s...
[18:47:00] [Iteration 1 at 2026-01-02 ...]
[18:47:00] Found 3 in_review tasks
[18:47:00] TASK-101: Reviewing...
[18:47:15] TASK-101: ✅ Merged to main
[18:47:20] Auto-merged 3 tasks this cycle
```

**Worker Pool Manager Log:**
```
[18:45:00] === Worker Pool Manager Starting ===
[18:45:00] Checking every 60s...
[18:45:00] Max workers: 3
[18:45:00] Available agents: 23

[Iteration 1 at 2026-01-02 ...]
[18:46:00] Active workers: 0/3
[18:46:00] Ready tasks: 15

[18:46:00] 🚀 Spawning new worker: Alice
[18:46:00] Ready tasks available: 15
[18:46:00] Active workers: 0/3
[18:46:00] SPAWN WORKER NOW via Task tool
[18:46:00] Waiting for worker to claim a task...

[Iteration 2 at 2026-01-02 ...]
[18:47:00] Active workers: 1/3
[18:47:00] Ready tasks: 14
[18:47:00] Current workers:
  - Alice: working on TASK-101

[Iteration 3 at 2026-01-02 ...]
[18:48:00] Active workers: 1/3
[18:48:00] Ready tasks: 14

[Iteration 4 at 2026-01-02 ...]
[18:49:00] Active workers: 2/3
[18:49:00] Ready tasks: 13

[18:50:00] 🚀 Spawning new worker: Bob
...

[Final log when all done]
[22:15:00] ✅ All work done!
[22:15:00] Session duration: 3h 30m
[22:15:00] Total workers spawned: 7
[22:15:00] Workers launched: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve, Frank, Grace
[22:15:00] === STOPPING ===
```

## Session Goals

1. ✅ Launch manager daemon (Terminal 1)
2. ✅ Launch worker pool manager (Terminal 2)
3. ✅ Monitor logs periodically (Terminal 3)
4. ✅ Only intervene for merge conflicts or critical failures
5. ✅ Let system run completely unattended
6. ✅ Check logs to see progress
7. ✅ Both agents stop automatically when work complete

## Stopping the Session

Both agents will auto-stop when:
- Manager Daemon: `ready == 0` and `in_progress == 0`
- Worker Pool Manager: `ready == 0` and `active_workers == 0`

You'll see in logs:
```
Manager: "All tasks done! Exiting..."
Worker Pool: "All work done! Stopping..."
```

## Key Differences from Previous Managers

- **Manual worker spawning** → **Worker pool manager auto-spawns**
- **Manual monitoring** → **Two automated agents (daemon + pool manager)**
- **You manage everything** → **You only intervene for critical issues**
- **Fixed worker count** → **Dynamic worker pool (spawns as needed)**
- **Multiple manual steps** → **Fully unsupervised session**

## Agent Naming

Worker pool manager uses sequential human names automatically:
- Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve, Frank, Grace, Heidi, Ivan, Judy, Kevin, Linda, Mike, Nia, Oscar, Peggy, Quinn, Rick, Stan, Tanya, Ulysses, Victor, Wendy, Xavier, Yvonne, Zach

23 total names available. If you exceed 23 workers in one session, it will warn and stop spawning.

---

**This is fully unsupervised workflow. Launch both agents, then walk away. The system will complete all work automatically.**

**Step 1:** Launch manager daemon
**Step 2:** Launch worker pool manager
**Step 3:** Monitor logs occasionally
**Step 4:** Only intervene for merge conflicts or critical failures
**Done.**
